## Introduction
Hiya, my name's Lottie and I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer! I live in London with my two dogs Watson and Chewie. I love running, reading, hiking and heading to the pub with pals! 

Here I'll be showcasing all I've learned on the *FullStack* course from _Code First Girls_. I'll be learning to use the following languages, frameworks & libraries 

* JavaScript 
* SQL
* React
* TypeScript
* Node

I'm super excited to get started <sup>and really hope this summer is a rainy one</sup>

Thanks for visiting, feedback is always apprecated and here's a **Top Tip** from one of our lead instructors
