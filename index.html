  <h3>Demonstrating knowledge and use of Git/GitHub commands</h3>
  <p> In this screenshot I show how I created a new branch; "Hello-World-Code", adding a new file to that branch; "index.html", checked the status and added a commit with a meaningful message. </p>
  <img id="imgOne" src="Media/New branch:file.png">
  <br>
  <p>I then pushed that code to GitHub from VSCode, creating a pull request within my GitHub for the new branch and code. </p>

  <p>Once I had opened the PR I then merged the branch to main and deleted it.</p>

<div class="gitIgnore">
  <h3>.gitignore & requirements.txt</h3>
  <p>A <b>.gitgnore</b> file tells Git which files should be ignored/not pushed to the remote repository. They're normally reserved for temporary files, generated files and those that contain passwords. You can create one by following these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project that needs the .gitignore file</li>
    <li>Code: 'touch .gitignore'</li>
    <li>If the command has succeeded there will be no output</li>
    <li>Open the .gitignore file and specify the files you want Git to ignore</li>
    <li>Commit and push as normal</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <p>A <b>requirements.txt</b> file tells a user which frameworks and libraries they'll need to use when working on a Python project.You can create one by following these steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the Python project that needs a requirements.txt file</li>
    <li>Code: 'pip freeze > requirements.txt'. to generate a file that has the currently installed libraries and frameworks</li>
    <li>If needed you can edit the file to only include the necessary libraries and frameworks</li>
    <li>Commit and push as normal</li>
  </ol>
